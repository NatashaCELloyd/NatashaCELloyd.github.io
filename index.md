## Personalisations and customisations!

Here we have two possibilities:

###### **If you would like a themed bundle/pack of stickers we don't have:**

 Contact us! We are happy to listen to your ideas!
 - a small custom fee will apply

  Let us know about any requests or restrictions.

###### **If you would like a pack of specific stickers (eg. family photos, specific photos, labels other than those already being sold)**
  
  Again, contact us! Make sure to send us all your photos/titles, and all the requirements such as size, outline, design (eg. cartoon, outline, realistic etc..)
- a small(but slightly larger than the themed pack) custom fee will apply
